This is the windows build of PyLotro.  If you got this in a zip and are
wondering how to install it, just extract the archive somewhere on your
hard drive and run pylotro.exe.

If you get an error about msvcr100.dll, install the Visual Studio 2010
runtime from http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=5555
